## Manual Testing

## Resolved Known Bugs

  There were some bugs and warnings after checking the markup code by the W3C Markup Validation Service. To solve the problems, I deleted the "id", changed aria-controls attribute, put the space in the nav div tag, and changed the section tag to div on serveral HTML files.

  There were 278 warnings after checking the Python code in views.py fiel using PEP8 online due to the trailing spaces and too many blank lines in between. Then I deleted all the trailing spaces and the blank lines to solve all the warnings. In the end, all errors and warnings are resolved.
